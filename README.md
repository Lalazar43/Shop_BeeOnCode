# Shop Market Project

This project is a fully functional e-commerce application built with React Hooks and styled using SCSS. It features a user-friendly interface that allows customers to browse products easily.

## Key Features:
- Search Bar: Users can search for products by article number.
- Genders Filter: Users can filter products by gender. (Note: Clicking on gender buttons multiple times will return the user to the main menu; this behavior will be improved in future updates.)
- Categories Filter: Users can filter products by categories. (Note: Clicking on a category button multiple times also returns the user to the main menu; this will be refined in future versions.)
- Subcategories: Users can explore products through various subcategories (note: subcategory functionality is under development).
- Price Filter: A price filter is implemented to help users find products within their budget (note: filtering functionality is currently being optimized).
- Add Categories/Subcategories: Admins can add new categories and subcategories to expand the product offerings.
- Add Product: Functionality for adding new products to the shop is included.

This project is an ongoing endeavor, and feedback is welcome as I continue to enhance its features and functionality!
